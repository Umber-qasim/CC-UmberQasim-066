** Attention Please **
All branches are visible in this repository because I used the command
git push --all
to ensure every branch from my Lab2 repository was transferred completely (including merged ones).
Some branches (like feature-exam, etc.) were already merged in Lab2 but reappeared here after pushing all branches.
The workflow and PR history remain the same as in the Lab2 repository.
